        <p>Intuition is fucking important. Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display. Don’t worry about what other people fucking think. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. Form follows fucking function. Learn from fucking criticism. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Design is all about.</p>
