Dal altra parte il cliente riceve fino a 5 preventivi da altri professionisti e imprese che hanno acquistato il contatto come te.</p>\\n        </section>\\n        <section>\\n          <h2>Problema</h2>\\n          <p>Analizziamo i vantaggi e svantaggi. Questi sistemi sono ottimi per trovare contatti e trasformarli in clienti, ma non \\u00E8 detto che il contatto sia reale o veramente interessato. Facendo due conti per ogni preventivo solo 1 su 5 delle imprese vince il lavoro. Quindi in media dovresti fare 5 preventivi per vincere uno. Non solo vincerlo ma anche assicurarti che il cliente sia regolare, che non cambi idea al ultimo minuto \\u00E8 che abbia chiaro la data del inizio dei lavori. Riassumendo in punti i problemi sono:</p>\\n          <ul>\\n            <li><strong>Nessuna garanzia di lavoro</strong></li>\\n            <li><strong>Alto tasso d'insuccesso</strong></li>\\n            <li><strong>Clienti non interessati</strong></li>\\n            <li><strong>Molta concorrenza</strong></li>\\n            <li><strong>Facilmente adatto alle truffe</strong></li>\\n          </ul>\\n        </section>\\n        <section>\\n          <h2>Soluzione</h2>\\n          <p>La soluzione non \\u00E8 standard per tutte le imprese che acquistano contatti online. Si potrebbero trovare centinaia di soluzioni validi, ma visto che i sistemi di cui parliamo sono online, le soluzioni si focalizzano in quel contesto. In sintesi le soluzioni sono:</p>\\n          <ul>\\n            <li><strong>Verifica dei contatti acquistati</strong></li>\\n            <li><strong>Controllare l'interessamento del cliente</strong></li>\\n            <li><strong>Inviare email professionali</strong></li>\\n            <li><strong>Inviare SMS professionali</strong></li>\\n            <li><strong>Aumentare il successo dei preventivi online</strong></li>\\n            <li><strong>Diventare competitivi</strong></li>\\n          </ul>\\n          <p>Questi sono delle soluzioni validi per verificare i vostri clienti, crescere il successo dei preventivi, chiedere rimborsi e ovviamente crescere i guadagni.</p>\\n        </section>\\n      </article>\\n      \"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Gli artigiani del web: 3 semplici modi per aumentare i clienti online\",\n                \"subtitle\": \"Hai un attività professionale, sei artigiano, idraulico, elettricista o altro e vuoi utilizzare il web per aumentare la tua clientela?

Ci sono <strong>decina</strong> di siti di annunci disponibili in Italia da anni ormai dove puoi inserire la tua azienda, la tua professione o quello che offri. Siti come <a href=\\\"http://www.subito.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Subito</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.bakeca.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Bakeca</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.kijiji.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Kijiji</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.secondamano.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Secondamano</a> e molte altre. Abbiamo anche i social network come Facebook con i gruppi professionali dove puoi semplicemente iscriverti e pubblicare il tuo annuncio a un pubblico selezionato e mirato.</p>\\n          <p>Gli annunci anche se un metodo classico di promozione per alcuni professionisti funzionano ancora, ma di certo <strong>esiste di meglio</strong>.</p>\\n        </section>\\n        <section>\\n          <h2>2. Le piattaforme</h2>\\n          <p>Poi ci sono le piattaforme di servizi locali adatte ai professionisti che vogliono avere un rapporto diretto con il potenziale cliente. Potenziale cliente perch\\u00E9 queste piattaforme funzionano tramite l\\u2019acquisto di un contatto (il cliente). Dopo l\\u2019acquisto \\u00E8 nelle mani del professionista puntare sulla comunicazione e sul prezzo per convertire il contatto in un cliente.</p>\\n          <p>Tuttavia alcune di queste piattaforme partono con un piano gratuito, altre con un periodo di prova e altre sono a pagamento per sempre. Per elencare alcune: <a href=\\\"https://www.prontopro.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ProntoPro</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.fazland.com/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Fazland</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.habitissimo.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Habitissimo</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.instapro.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Instapro</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.preventivi.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Preventivi</a> e molte altre.</p>\\n          <p>Le scelte attuali di un professionista sono queste ma non \\u00E8 detto che non si possa trovare o fare di meglio.</p>\\n        </section>\\n        <section>\\n          <h2>3. Pubblicit\\u00E0 online</h2>\\n          <p>La pubblicit\\u00E0 online invece \\u00E8 un altro metodo valido per poter promuovere la propria attivit\\u00E0 e acquisire nuovi clienti. Diversamente dagli altri modi questo dipende sia dal tuo annuncio, dal prezzo che spendi per l\\u2019annuncio e dalla tua comunicazione.</p>\\n          <p>Uno strumento semplice da utilizzare se sei confidente con il web e relativamente economico si chiama <a href=\\\"https://adwords.google.com/express/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Google Adwords Express</a>.</p>\\n

Ormai da qualche tempo, infatti, il web si \\u00E8 popolato di piattaforme per la prenotazione di servizi che promettono ai loro utilizzatori notevoli vantaggi in termini non soltanto di tempo, ma anche di denaro: sconti dedicati, professionisti a completa disposizione della clientela e uno staff in grado di garantire il suo supporto sono stati i punti a favore di questo nuovo fenomeno che, stando ad alcune statistiche, sembra destinato ad espandersi. Scopriamo come funziona il booking dei servizi e perch\\u00E9 \\u00E8 tanto apprezzato.</p>\\n        <section>\\n          <h2>Come funziona e perch\\u00E9 ha riscosso tanto successo</h2>\\n          <p>Il funzionamento dei sistemi di booking on line \\u00E8 in realt\\u00E0 pi\\u00F9 semplice di quanto si potrebbe pensare. Basta collegarsi alla piattaforma scelta, inserire il tipo di servizio desiderato e la data in cui si desidera godere di quel determinato servizio e avviare la ricerca. In pochi secondi, sar\\u00E0 possibile visualizzare le diverse offerte disponibili e prenotare direttamente l'intervento desiderato.</p>\\n          <p>Facile intuire il motivo di tanto apprezzamento da parte degli utilizzatori di questo servizio: oltre alla gi\\u00E0 citata semplicit\\u00E0 di utilizzo e ai prezzi convenienti, a rassicurare coloro che scelgono i servizi di booking on line \\u00E8 la selezione dei professionisti che si appoggiano a queste piattaforme. Lo staff, infatti, garantisce che ogni addetto viene scelto per la sua capacit\\u00E0 di rispondere alle richieste della clientela, rispettando obblighi di legge e standard elevati. Un ottimo modo per fare s\\u00EC che domanda e offerta si incontrino.</p>\\n        </section>\\n        <section>\\n          <h2>Un servizio da non sottovalutare</h2>\\n          <p>Il consiglio, pertanto, non pu\\u00F2 che essere quello di provare questo tipo di servizio.

INFORMAZIONI RACCOLTE DA STARBOOK</strong></p>\\n      <p>1.1. Nel visitare il Sito o nell’utilizzare il Servizio per inoltrare un Ordine ad un professionista tramite il Sito, è possibile che venga richiesto di fornire informazioni che riguardano l’utente, ivi incluso nome, recapiti (quali numero di telefono fisso, di telefono mobile e indirizzo e-mail) e dati relativi al pagamento (quali i dati della carta di credito o di debito). STARBOOK può inoltre raccogliere informazioni relative all’utilizzo del Sito e del Servizio da parte dell’utente nonché può raccogliere informazioni relative all’utente a partire dai materiali (quali messaggi e recensioni) che l’utente stesso pubblica sul Sito o trasmette al Sito o che invia a STARBOOK tramite e-mail o per lettera.</p>\\n      <p><strong>2. USO DELLE INFORMAZIONI</strong></p>\\n      <p>2.1. Le informazioni degli utenti consentono a STARBOOK di fornire agli utenti stessi l’accesso alle sezioni del Sito cui sono interessati e di fornire il Servizio. Esse mettono inoltre STARBOOK in grado di fatturare gli importi dovuti e consentono a STARBOOK o ad un professionista cui l’utente abbia inoltrato un Ordine di contattare l’utente in merito al Servizio, ove necessario. Ad esempio, STARBOOK e/o il professionista possono utilizzare i dati dell’utente per fornire allo stesso aggiornamenti sullo stato dell'Ordine o altre informazioni relative alla stessa mediante e-mail, per telefono fisso o mobile o tramite messaggistica mobile. Inoltre, STARBOOK utilizza ed analizza le informazioni raccolte al fine di gestire, sostenere, migliorare e sviluppare la propria attività imprenditoriale, per eventuali altre finalità statistiche o analitiche nonché per contribuire alla prevenzione di frodi. Nei casi in cui sia opportuno, ora e in futuro, l’utente potrebbe avere la capacità di esprimere le proprie preferenze riguardo all’utilizzo dei propri dati secondo quanto previsto nella presente Informativa in materia di Privacy e di esercitarla tramite la metodologia prescelta dall’utente per l’utilizzo del Servizio, ad esempio, in modalità mobile, tramite applicazioni mobili o l’eventuale rappresentazione del Sito.<br>\\n      2.2. STARBOOK può utilizzare le informazioni per contattare il cliente al fine di conoscere, con il suo consenso, le sue opinioni sul Servizio ed occasionalmente di informarlo delle modifiche o degli sviluppi importanti che riguardano il Sito o il Servizio suddetto.<br>\\n      2.3. STARBOOK potrà utilizzare l’indirizzo email fornito dall’utente del Sito al momento dell’acquisto di prodotti in vendita sul Sito per far conoscere allo stesso utente i prodotti e servizi di STARBOOK, simili a quelli già acquistati, che possano riscuotere il suo interesse. L’utente potrà in ogni momento, gratuitamente e con effetto immediato opporsi all’utilizzo del proprio indirizzo email per la ricezione di tale materiale informativo cliccando sull’apposito link inserito in calce a ciascuna email ricevuta. In alternativa, l’utente potrà opporsi a tale trattamento anche modificando le preferenze dalla relativa sezione del proprio profilo. Per gestire le notifiche, l’utente dovrà accedere alla pagina delle impostazioni del suo telefono o tablet e modificare l'autorizzazione alle notifiche per l'applicazione STARBOOK. In caso di disattivazione delle notifiche, l’utente non potrà più ricevere aggiornamenti sui suoi ordini via notifiche.<br>\\n      2.4. Se consentito dall’utente del Sito, STARBOOK potrà utilizzare i dati per far conoscere all’utente suddetto gli altri prodotti e servizi di STARBOOK che possano riscuotere il suo interesse, ivi inclusi servizi che possano essere oggetto di direct marketing mediante sistemi di messaggistica tramite cellulare e attraverso le notifiche.<br>\\n      2.5. Qualora l’utente non desideri più che i suoi dati siano utilizzati da STARBOOK nei modi sopra indicati o cambi idea riguardo alla possibilità di essere contattato in futuro, si prega di farlo sapere a STARBOOK utilizzando i recapiti indicati al successivo articolo 8 e/o modificando corrispondentemente il proprio profilo.<br>\\n      2.6. Qualora l’utente non desideri più che i suoi dati siano utilizzati da STARBOOK nei modi sopra indicati o cambi idea riguardo alla possibilità di essere contattato in futuro, si prega di opporsi al trattamento nei modi su indicati. In mancanza, è possibile informare in ogni momento farlo sapere a STARBOOK della propria decisione, utilizzando i recapiti indicati al successivo articolo 8 e/o modificando corrispondentemente il proprio profilo.</p>\\n\\n      <h1>Condizioni d'utilizzo</h1>\\n      <p><strong>1. ACCESSO E REGOLAMENTO DEL SITO STARBOOK</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>1.1. Accesso al Sito: </strong>E’ possibile avere accesso ad alcune aree del Sito web anche senza effettuare un Ordine o senza procedere alla registrazione dei propri dati. La maggior parte delle aree del Sito sono accessibili a chiunque.<br>\\n      <strong>1.2. Accettazione del Regolamento del Sito:</strong> La navigazione in qualunque area del Sito comporta l'accettazione del Regolamento del Sito. I visitatori ed utenti del Sito che rifiutino di accettare il Regolamento del Sito sono tenuti a lasciare immediatamente il Sito e non avranno la possibilità di ordinare servizi tramite il Sito stesso.<br>\\n      <strong>1.3. Modifiche al Regolamento del Sito:</strong> STARBOOK ha facoltà di modificare il presente Regolamento del Sito in qualsiasi momento. Occorre pertanto controllare periodicamente il Regolamento del Sito in vigore al momento poiché essa vincola i visitatori e gli utenti del Sito. I visitatori e utenti del Sito sono tenuti al rispetto delle policy e della disciplina in vigore al momento in cui effettuano un Ordine tramite STARBOOK.<br>\\n      <strong>1.4. Responsabilità:</strong> Spetta ai visitatori e utenti del Sito predisporre quanto necessario per avere accesso al Sito stesso. Inoltre, i visitatori e utenti del Sito sono tenuti a garantire che tutti coloro che hanno accesso al Sito tramite la loro connessione ad Internet siano a conoscenza del presente Regolamento del Sito e la rispettino.</p>\\n      <p><strong>2. STATUS DELL’UTENTE DEL SITO STARBOOK</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>2.1. Capacità giuridica ed età: </strong>Effettuando un Ordine tramite il Sito, l’utente garantisce:<br>\\n      <strong>2.1.1.</strong> di aver la capacità di agire e concludere contratti giuridicamente vincolanti<br>\\n      <strong>2.1.2.</strong> di avere compiuto 18 anni</p>\\n      <p><strong>3. MODALITÀ DI EMISSIONE DELL ORDINE E DI ELABORAZIONE DELL’ORDINE</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>3.1. Compilazione dell’Ordine: </strong>Dopo aver selezionato il servizio che intende ordinare da un professionista prescelto dalla piattaforma ed aver fornito le informazioni, l’utente ha facoltà di effettuare l’Ordine cliccando sul, o selezionando il, pulsante “Procedi con l'ordine” e “Procedi con l'acquisto”. Si ricorda che è importante controllare tutte le informazioni immesse e correggere eventuali errori prima di cliccare sul pulsante o di selezionarlo poiché, dopo averlo fatto, il procedimento di elaborazione dell’Ordine ha inizio e non è più possibile correggere eventuali errori.<br>\\n      <strong>3.2. Modifica o annullamento dell’Ordine: </strong>Una volta che l’Ordine è stato inoltrato e il pagamento è stato autorizzato non è più possibile modificare o annullare l’Ordine e non si ha diritto ad alcun rimborso. Ove desideri modificare o annullare l’Ordine, l’utente può rivolgersi al Servizio Clienti, il quale tenterà di contattare il professionista al fine di comunicargli la richiesta dell’utente. Non vi è alcuna assicurazione, tuttavia, riguardo al fatto che il Servizio Clienti sarà in grado di contattare il professionista o che il professionista accetterà le richieste dell’utente in quanto il processo di elaborazione dell’Ordine potrebbe avere già avuto inizio. Il cliente, ai sensi dell'art. 55 lett. a) del Codice del Consumo, non ha diritto a recedere dagli Ordini effettuati una volta che il bene o servizio richiesto è stato consegnato.<br>\\n      <strong>3.3. Autorizzazione al pagamento:</strong> In caso di mancata autorizzazione relativa ad un qualsiasi pagamento, l’Ordine non viene elaborato o non viene comunicato alla piattaforma.<br>\\n      <strong>3.4. Elaborazione dell’Ordine e rifiuto di Ordini da parte del professionista: </strong>Alla ricezione dell’Ordine, STARBOOK ne inizia l’elaborazione con la trasmissione dello stesso ai professionisti interessati e notifica all’utente, tramite sms e mail, che l’Ordine è stato assegnato. Si specifica che qualsiasi pagina di conferma che l’utente possa visualizzare sul Sito e qualsiasi conferma di Ordine che l’utente stesso riceva tramite e-mail indicano esclusivamente che l'Ordine dell’utente è stato assegnato o è in corso. STARBOOK incoraggia tutti i propri professionisti ad accettare tutti gli Ordini ed a comunicare tempestivamente eventuali rifiuti, e comunica all’utente (generalmente tramite e-mail) non appena sia ragionevolmente possibile ogni eventuale rifiuto da parte del professionista. In ogni caso, i professionisti possono scegliere di rifiutare gli Ordini in qualsiasi momento per il fatto di essere eccessivamente impegnati, a causa delle condizioni atmosferiche o per qualsiasi altra ragione.<br>\\n      <strong>3.5. Finitura del servizio:</strong> I tempi stimati per i servizi dal inizio a fine lavori variano tra 1-2 giorni a seconda del tipo di servizio ordinato. STARBOOK e i professionisti non garantiscono che i servizi verranno finiti entro i tempi stimati.</p>\\n      <p><strong>4. PREZZO E PAGAMENTO</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>4.1. IVA e costi di servizio:</strong> I prezzi sono quelli indicati sul Sito. I prezzi sono comprensivi di IVA. Tali costi vengono aggiunti all’importo totale dovuto, se applicabili.<br>\\n      <strong>4.2. Errata indicazione del prezzo:</strong> Il presente Sito web contiene un vasto numero di menu ed è sempre possibile che alcuni di essi possano recare una indicazione inesatta del prezzo. Qualora il prezzo esatto di un Ordine sia più elevato del prezzo indicato sul Sito, STARBOOK normalmente provvede a contattare l’utente prima della spedizione dell'Ordine. In tal caso, né STARBOOK né il professionista interessato hanno alcun obbligo di assicurare che l'Ordine venga fornito all’utente al prezzo inferiore erroneamente indicato né di rimborsare all’utente la differenza rispetto al prezzo errato. In caso il prezzo sia eccessivamente elevato rispetto al prezzo originariamente convenuto e l'utente sia un consumatore ai sensi del Codice del Consumo, l'utente avrà facoltà di recedere dall'Ordine.<br>\\n      <strong>4.3. Modalità di pagamento:</strong> Il pagamento dei servizi deve essere effettuato mediante una carta di credito/debito.<br>\\n      <p><strong>5. SERVIZIO CLIENTI</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>5.1 Disposizioni Generali:</strong> STARBOOK considera il Servizio Clienti estremamente importante. Il Servizio Clienti cerca dunque di prestare assistenza all’utente, quando possibile, in caso di problemi con l'Ordine. L’utente può entrare in contatto con il Servizio Clienti andando sulla pagina help del sito.<br>\\n      <strong>5.2. Modifica o annullamento dell'Ordine:</strong> Ove l’utente desideri modificare o annullare il proprio Ordine dopo che esso sia stata inoltrato e il relativo pagamento autorizzato, l’utente ha facoltà di rivolgersi al Servizio Clienti STARBOOK, con le modalità sopra descritte, il quale tenterà di entrare in contatto con il professionista al fine di comunicare le richieste del cliente. Non vi è alcuna assicurazione, tuttavia, riguardo al fatto che il Servizio Clienti STARBOOK sarà in grado di contattare il professionista o che il professionista accetterà le richieste dell’utente in quanto il processo di elaborazione dell'Ordine potrebbe avere già avuto inizio.<br>\\n      <strong>5.3. Reclami e feedback da parte degli utenti:</strong> Nell’eventualità che l’utente non sia soddisfatto della qualità di un qualsiasi servizio o del servizio fornito da un professionista, STARBOOK invita l’utente a far conoscere la propria opinione tramite il Sito, in forma di valutazioni, commenti e recensioni che riflettano la propria esperienza. Le Recensioni sono una parte importante del processo di controllo qualità di STARBOOK.<br>\\n      <strong>5.4. Risarcimento:</strong> Nell’eventualità che l’utente non sia soddisfatto della qualità di un qualsiasi servizio o del servizio fornito da un professionista e desideri richiedere un rimborso, una riduzione proporzionale del prezzo o qualsiasi altra forma di risarcimento, è tenuto a contattare direttamente il professionista al fine di presentare il proprio reclamo e, se del caso, ad osservare le procedure di reclamo previste dal professionista stesso. Qualora l’utente non sia in grado di contattare il professionista, o qualora il professionista rifiuti di occuparsi del reclamo dell’utente, quest’ultimo può rivolgersi al Servizio Clienti STARBOOK con le modalità sopra descritte entro 48 ore dall’inoltro dell'Ordine e uno dei Consulenti del Servizio Clienti STARBOOK tenterà di contattare il professionista al fine di richiedere un risarcimento per conto dell’utente. Si fa presente che STARBOOK non ha alcun controllo sui professionisti né sulla qualità dei servizi o sul servizio fornito dai professionisti stessi e non è in grado di fornire, né assume alcuna responsabilità o impegno di fornire, alcun risarcimento in favore dell’utente per conto di qualsiasi professionista.</p>\\n      <p><strong>6.

Non pensarci troppo, mettiti seduto per 2 minuti, leggi questo articolo e scopri perché il web e la tua salvezza.</p>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Più web, più clienti</h2>\n          <p>Il web non è solo uno strumento di divertimento. Si possono trovare <strong>migliaia di clienti</strong> utilizzando i canali giusti. Nel web non hai bisogno di essere conosciuto per poter trovare un cliente, ti basta migliorare la tua <strong>immagine aziendale</strong> e <strong>tecniche di marketing</strong> per farlo. Adesso i consumatori sono più fiduciari nei sistemi digitali. Comprano, prenotano senza avere il timore di essere truffati. Il web stesso è più sicuro che mai, le transazioni sono più sicure. Quindi offrire i tuoi servizi online è già un <strong>vantaggio competitivo</strong> che dovresti avere.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Poca concorrenza</h2>\n          <p>Essendo che il web venga utilizzato da pochi impresari, la <strong>concorrenza è minima</strong> ed è un altro motivo perché dovresti investire per trovare clienti online invece che continuare con i sistemi tradizionali. La concorrenza non lo batterai mai con la qualità del tuo lavoro ma innovandoti giorno dopo giorno, nuovi sistemi di promozione ogni giorno e avrai sempre <strong>nuove opportunità</strong>.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Prezzo giusto ma più guadagni</h2>\n          <p>Un altro motivo perché dovresti utilizzare il web per promuovere la tua attività è che non devi fare <strong>troppi sconti</strong>. Se sei unico sei anche prezioso e quindi il cliente non ha molta scelta. L’innovazione ti permette di essere <strong>all’avanguardia</strong> e di decidere anche il prezzo. Questo ti permette non solo di lavorare nel modo giusto ma anche di <strong>crescere i guadagni</strong> e il fatturato.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Vuoi sapere di più?

Tuttavia ci sono cose che devi conoscere prima di iniziare ad utilizzarli e prima di spendere soldi inutilmente.</p>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Il funzionamento</h2>\n          <p>Come abbiamo già parlato anche in un <a href=\"/blog/Gli-artigiani-del-web%3A-3-semplici-modi-per-aumentare-i-clienti-online\" target=\"_blank\">altro articolo</a> su come aumentare i clienti online, il funzionamento di questi siti è semplice. Ti iscrivi come impresa, inserisci la P.IVA, selezioni la tua professione e inizi a ricevere offerte di lavoro. Ogni volta che c’è una nuova richiesta di preventivo ti arriva una notifica email e un SMS. A quel punto decidi di comprare il contatto e d’inviarli un preventivo. I prezzi variano dai 5 ai 20€ per ogni preventivo o contatto acquistato. Dal altra parte il cliente riceve fino a 5 preventivi da altri professionisti e imprese che hanno acquistato il contatto come te.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Problema</h2>\n          <p>Analizziamo i vantaggi e svantaggi. Questi sistemi sono ottimi per trovare contatti e trasformarli in clienti, ma non è detto che il contatto sia reale o veramente interessato. Facendo due conti per ogni preventivo solo 1 su 5 delle imprese vince il lavoro. Quindi in media dovresti fare 5 preventivi per vincere uno. Non solo vincerlo ma anche assicurarti che il cliente sia regolare, che non cambi idea al ultimo minuto è che abbia chiaro la data del inizio dei lavori. Riassumendo in punti i problemi sono:</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li><strong>Nessuna garanzia di lavoro</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Alto tasso d'insuccesso</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Clienti non interessati</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Molta concorrenza</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Facilmente adatto alle truffe</strong></li>\n          </ul>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Soluzione</h2>\n          <p>La soluzione non è standard per tutte le imprese che acquistano contatti online. Si potrebbero trovare centinaia di soluzioni validi, ma visto che i sistemi di cui parliamo sono online, le soluzioni si focalizzano in quel contesto. In sintesi le soluzioni sono:</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li><strong>Verifica dei contatti acquistati</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Controllare l'interessamento del cliente</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Inviare email professionali</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Inviare SMS professionali</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Aumentare il successo dei preventivi online</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Diventare competitivi</strong></li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>Questi sono delle soluzioni validi per verificare i vostri clienti, crescere il successo dei preventivi, chiedere rimborsi e ovviamente crescere i guadagni.</p>\n        </section>\n      </article>\n      `\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\" : \"Gli artigiani del web: 3 semplici modi per aumentare i clienti online\",\n      \"subtitle\" : \"Hai un attività professionale, sei artigiano, idraulico, elettricista o altro e vuoi utilizzare il web per aumentare la tua clientela?

Ecco quali sono i 3 modi che puoi seguire per utilizzarlo in modo saggio:</p>\n        <section>\n          <h2>1. Gli annunci</h2>\n          <p>Scontato come opzione ma sottovalutato da molti. Ci sono <strong>decina</strong> di siti di annunci disponibili in Italia da anni ormai dove puoi inserire la tua azienda, la tua professione o quello che offri. Siti come <a href=\"http://www.subito.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Subito</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bakeca.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bakeca</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kijiji.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Kijiji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.secondamano.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Secondamano</a> e molte altre. Abbiamo anche i social network come Facebook con i gruppi professionali dove puoi semplicemente iscriverti e pubblicare il tuo annuncio a un pubblico selezionato e mirato.</p>\n          <p>Gli annunci anche se un metodo classico di promozione per alcuni professionisti funzionano ancora, ma di certo <strong>esiste di meglio</strong>.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h2>2. Le piattaforme</h2>\n          <p>Poi ci sono le piattaforme di servizi locali adatte ai professionisti che vogliono avere un rapporto diretto con il potenziale cliente. Potenziale cliente perché queste piattaforme funzionano tramite l’acquisto di un contatto (il cliente). Dopo l’acquisto è nelle mani del professionista puntare sulla comunicazione e sul prezzo per convertire il contatto in un cliente.</p>\n          <p>Tuttavia alcune di queste piattaforme partono con un piano gratuito, altre con un periodo di prova e altre sono a pagamento per sempre. Per elencare alcune: <a href=\"https://www.prontopro.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ProntoPro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fazland.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Fazland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.habitissimo.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Habitissimo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instapro.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Instapro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.preventivi.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Preventivi</a> e molte altre.</p>\n          <p>Le scelte attuali di un professionista sono queste ma non è detto che non si possa trovare o fare di meglio.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h2>3. Pubblicità online</h2>\n          <p>La pubblicità online invece è un altro metodo valido per poter promuovere la propria attività e acquisire nuovi clienti. Diversamente dagli altri modi questo dipende sia dal tuo annuncio, dal prezzo che spendi per l’annuncio e dalla tua comunicazione.</p>\n          <p>Uno strumento semplice da utilizzare se sei confidente con il web e relativamente economico si chiama <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/express/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google Adwords Express</a>.</p>\n          <p>Un altro strumento è <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Ads</a> che è leggermente più complessa ma vale la pena provare.</p>\n        </section>\n      </article>\n      `\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\" : \"Le piattaforme digitali: come gestire il tempo nell'era della new economy\",\n      \"subtitle\" : \"Il tempo è un'illusione eppure è l'unica risorsa con maggior valore nella nostra vita e nel era digitale il tempo è diventato uno strumento difficile da gestire ma cruciale per sopravvivere.\",\n      \"picture_url\" : \"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/starbook-s3/blog/online-booking-servizi.png\",\n      \"author\": {\n        \"fullname\" : \"Harald Bregu\",\n        \"headline\" : \"Sviluppatore, Software, Starbook, Startup\",\n        \"picture_url\" : \"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/starbook-s3/accounts/595ccfb42bf14e6650ce6e3d/avatar/0\"\n      },\n      \"updated_at\" : \"19 Lug 2017\",\n      \"timing\" : \"3 min lettura\",\n      \"html_body\" : `\n      <article>\n        <header>\n          <h1>Le piattaforme digitali: come gestire il tempo nell'era della new economy</h1>\n          <p>\n            <time><i class=\"fa fa-calendar\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> 19 Lug 2017</time>\n            <time><i class=\"fa fa-clock-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> 3 min</time>\n            <author><i class=\"fa fa-user\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> Harald Bregu</author>\n          </p>\n          <div class=\"share-links\">\n            <ul>\n            <li class=\"facebook\">\n              <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A//www.starbook.co/blog/Le-piattaforme-digitali%3A-come-gestire-il-tempo-nell'era-della-new-economy\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i class=\"fa fa-facebook\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <span>Facebook</span></a>\n            </li>\n            <li class=\"twitter line\">\n              <a href=\"https://twitter.com/home?status=https%3A//www.starbook.co/blog/Le-piattaforme-digitali%3A-come-gestire-il-tempo-nell'era-della-new-economy\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i class=\"fa fa-twitter\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <span>Twitter</span></a>\n            </li>\n            <li class=\"google line\">\n              <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A//www.starbook.co/blog/Le-piattaforme-digitali%3A-come-gestire-il-tempo-nell'era-della-new-economy\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i class=\"fa fa-google-plus\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <span>Google+</span></a>\n            </li>\n            <li class=\"pinterest line\">\n              <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A//www.starbook.co/blog/Le-piattaforme-digitali%3A-come-gestire-il-tempo-nell&media=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/starbook-s3/blog/online-booking-servizi.png&description=Le piattaforme digitali: come gestire il tempo nell'era della new economy'era-della-new-economy\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i class=\"fa fa-pinterest-p\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <span>Pinterest</span></a>\n            </li>\n            <li class=\"linkedin line\">\n              <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A//www.starbook.co/blog/Le-piattaforme-digitali%3A-come-gestire-il-tempo-nell'era-della-new-economy&title=&summary=&source=\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i class=\"fa fa-linkedin\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <span>LinkedIn</span></a>\n            </li>\n            </ul>\n          </div>\n          <p>\n          </p>\n        </header>\n        <p>Il tempo è un'illusione eppure è l'unica risorsa con maggior valore nella nostra vita e nel era digitale il tempo è diventato uno strumento difficile da gestire ma cruciale per sopravvivere.</p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/starbook-s3/blog/online-booking-servizi.png\" alt=\"Piattaforme digitali\" title=\"Piattaforme digitali\"/></p>\n        <p>Parliamo dell’economia on demand e della condivisione che hanno avuto un influenza dirompente nel futuro del mondo e del lavoro.</p>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Perché adattarsi alla nuova era digitale</h2>\n          <p>L’economia on demand è l’acquisto di quel particolare bene materiale o prestazione occasionale solo quando hai bisogno senza sprecare tempo. Infatti solo quando hai bisogno di un passaggio in auto chiami un Uber. Quando vuoi mangiare a pranzo, te lo fai portare da Deliveroo, Foodora, JustEat. Quando devi fare delle commissioni, utilizzi Jobby o Vicker che sono nate in Italia negli ultimi mesi.

Ormai da qualche tempo, infatti, il web si è popolato di piattaforme per la prenotazione di servizi che promettono ai loro utilizzatori notevoli vantaggi in termini non soltanto di tempo, ma anche di denaro: sconti dedicati, professionisti a completa disposizione della clientela e uno staff in grado di garantire il suo supporto sono stati i punti a favore di questo nuovo fenomeno che, stando ad alcune statistiche, sembra destinato ad espandersi. Scopriamo come funziona il booking dei servizi e perché è tanto apprezzato.</p>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Come funziona e perché ha riscosso tanto successo</h2>\n          <p>Il funzionamento dei sistemi di booking on line è in realtà più semplice di quanto si potrebbe pensare. Basta collegarsi alla piattaforma scelta, inserire il tipo di servizio desiderato e la data in cui si desidera godere di quel determinato servizio e avviare la ricerca. In pochi secondi, sarà possibile visualizzare le diverse offerte disponibili e prenotare direttamente l'intervento desiderato.</p>\n          <p>Facile intuire il motivo di tanto apprezzamento da parte degli utilizzatori di questo servizio: oltre alla già citata semplicità di utilizzo e ai prezzi convenienti, a rassicurare coloro che scelgono i servizi di booking on line è la selezione dei professionisti che si appoggiano a queste piattaforme. Lo staff, infatti, garantisce che ogni addetto viene scelto per la sua capacità di rispondere alle richieste della clientela, rispettando obblighi di legge e standard elevati. Un ottimo modo per fare sì che domanda e offerta si incontrino.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Un servizio da non sottovalutare</h2>\n          <p>Il consiglio, pertanto, non può che essere quello di provare questo tipo di servizio. Sia che si tratti di trovare un professionista che possa tinteggiare casa o, magari, installare dei nuovi sanitari, un motore di ricerca dedicato potrà aiutare il padrone di casa a mettersi in contatto con uno staff attento alle richieste della clientela e in grado di intervenire in poco tempo.</p>\n        </section>\n      </article>\n      `\n    },\n  ]\n  constructor() { }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/app/pages/blog/posts.service.ts","import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class ShareService {\n  private object;\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  setObject(object) {\n    this.object = object;\n  }\n  getObject() {\n    return this.object;\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/app/pages/share/share.service.ts","import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';\nconst PADDING = \"000000\";\n\n@Pipe({\n  name: 'currency'\n})\nexport class CurrencyPipe implements PipeTransform {\n  private PREFIX: string\n  private DECIMAL_SEPARATOR: string;\n  private THOUSANDS_SEPARATOR: string;\n  private SUFFIX: string\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.PREFIX = ''\n    this.DECIMAL_SEPARATOR = \".\";\n    this.THOUSANDS_SEPARATOR = \" \";\n    this.SUFFIX = ' €'\n  }\n\n  transform(value: string, fractionSize: number = 2): string {\n    let [ integer, fraction = \"\" ] = (value || \"\").toString().split(\".\");\n    fraction = fractionSize > 0 ? this.DECIMAL_SEPARATOR + (fraction + PADDING).substring(0, fractionSize) : \"\";\n    integer = integer.replace(/\\B(?=(\\d{3})+(?!\\d))/g, this.THOUSANDS_SEPARATOR);\n    var amount = this.PREFIX + integer + fraction;\n    // var clear_amount = amount.replace(/\\D/g,'');\n    return amount;\n  }\n\n  parse(value: string, fractionSize: number = 2): string {\n    let [ integer, fraction = \"\" ] = (value || \"\").replace(this.PREFIX, \"\").replace(this.SUFFIX, \"\").split(this.DECIMAL_SEPARATOR);\n    integer = integer.replace(new RegExp(this.THOUSANDS_SEPARATOR, \"g\"), \"\");\n    fraction = parseInt(fraction, 10) > 0 && fractionSize > 0 ? this.DECIMAL_SEPARATOR + (fraction + PADDING).substring(0, fractionSize) : \"\";\n    var amount = integer + fraction;\n    // amount = amount.replace(/\\D/g,'');\n    return amount;\n  }\n\n  // parseCents(value: string, fractionSize: number = 2): string {\n  //   let [ integer, fraction = \"\" ] = (value || \"\").replace(this.PREFIX, \"\").replace(this.SUFFIX, \"\").split(this.DECIMAL_SEPARATOR);\n  //   integer = integer.replace(new RegExp(this.THOUSANDS_SEPARATOR, \"g\"), \"\");\n  //   fraction = parseInt(fraction, 10) > 0 && fractionSize > 0 ? this.DECIMAL_SEPARATOR + (fraction + PADDING).substring(0, fractionSize) : \"\";\n  //   var amount = integer + fraction;\n  //   // amount = amount.replace(/\\D/g,'');\n  //   return amount;\n  // }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/app/pipes/currency.pipe.ts","module.exports = require(\"@angular/forms\");\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// external \"@angular/forms\"\n// module id = 20\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = require(\"@angular/platform-browser\");\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// external \"@angular/platform-browser\"\n// module id = 21\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = require(\"rxjs/Subject\");\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// external \"rxjs/Subject\"\n// module id = 22\n// module chunks = 0","import { isBrowser } from 'angular2-universal';\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SeoService } from '../shared/seo.service';\nimport { Router, Route, ActivatedRoute, Params } from '@angular/router';\nimport { AuthService } from '../shared/auth.service';\nimport { FacebookService, InitParams, LoginResponse, LoginOptions, UIResponse, UIParams, FBVideoComponent } from 'ngx-facebook';\nimport { NavigationService } from '../shared/navigation.service';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-company',\n  templateUrl: './company.component.html'\n})\nexport class CompanyComponent implements OnInit {\n  public seoObject = {}\n  public page = null\n  public Account;\n\n  constructor(private navigationService: NavigationService, private router: Router, private route: ActivatedRoute, private seoService: SeoService, private authServics: AuthService, private fb: FacebookService) {\n    this.navigationService.updateMessage(\"Crea.

INFORMAZIONI RACCOLTE DA STARBOOK</strong></p>\\n      <p>1.1. Nel visitare il Sito o nell’utilizzare il Servizio per inoltrare un Ordine ad un professionista tramite il Sito, è possibile che venga richiesto di fornire informazioni che riguardano l’utente, ivi incluso nome, recapiti (quali numero di telefono fisso, di telefono mobile e indirizzo e-mail) e dati relativi al pagamento (quali i dati della carta di credito o di debito). STARBOOK può inoltre raccogliere informazioni relative all’utilizzo del Sito e del Servizio da parte dell’utente nonché può raccogliere informazioni relative all’utente a partire dai materiali (quali messaggi e recensioni) che l’utente stesso pubblica sul Sito o trasmette al Sito o che invia a STARBOOK tramite e-mail o per lettera.</p>\\n      <p><strong>2. USO DELLE INFORMAZIONI</strong></p>\\n      <p>2.1. Le informazioni degli utenti consentono a STARBOOK di fornire agli utenti stessi l’accesso alle sezioni del Sito cui sono interessati e di fornire il Servizio. Esse mettono inoltre STARBOOK in grado di fatturare gli importi dovuti e consentono a STARBOOK o ad un professionista cui l’utente abbia inoltrato un Ordine di contattare l’utente in merito al Servizio, ove necessario. Ad esempio, STARBOOK e/o il professionista possono utilizzare i dati dell’utente per fornire allo stesso aggiornamenti sullo stato dell'Ordine o altre informazioni relative alla stessa mediante e-mail, per telefono fisso o mobile o tramite messaggistica mobile. Inoltre, STARBOOK utilizza ed analizza le informazioni raccolte al fine di gestire, sostenere, migliorare e sviluppare la propria attività imprenditoriale, per eventuali altre finalità statistiche o analitiche nonché per contribuire alla prevenzione di frodi. Nei casi in cui sia opportuno, ora e in futuro, l’utente potrebbe avere la capacità di esprimere le proprie preferenze riguardo all’utilizzo dei propri dati secondo quanto previsto nella presente Informativa in materia di Privacy e di esercitarla tramite la metodologia prescelta dall’utente per l’utilizzo del Servizio, ad esempio, in modalità mobile, tramite applicazioni mobili o l’eventuale rappresentazione del Sito.<br>\\n      2.2. STARBOOK può utilizzare le informazioni per contattare il cliente al fine di conoscere, con il suo consenso, le sue opinioni sul Servizio ed occasionalmente di informarlo delle modifiche o degli sviluppi importanti che riguardano il Sito o il Servizio suddetto.<br>\\n      2.3. STARBOOK potrà utilizzare l’indirizzo email fornito dall’utente del Sito al momento dell’acquisto di prodotti in vendita sul Sito per far conoscere allo stesso utente i prodotti e servizi di STARBOOK, simili a quelli già acquistati, che possano riscuotere il suo interesse. L’utente potrà in ogni momento, gratuitamente e con effetto immediato opporsi all’utilizzo del proprio indirizzo email per la ricezione di tale materiale informativo cliccando sull’apposito link inserito in calce a ciascuna email ricevuta. In alternativa, l’utente potrà opporsi a tale trattamento anche modificando le preferenze dalla relativa sezione del proprio profilo. Per gestire le notifiche, l’utente dovrà accedere alla pagina delle impostazioni del suo telefono o tablet e modificare l'autorizzazione alle notifiche per l'applicazione STARBOOK. In caso di disattivazione delle notifiche, l’utente non potrà più ricevere aggiornamenti sui suoi ordini via notifiche.<br>\\n      2.4. Se consentito dall’utente del Sito, STARBOOK potrà utilizzare i dati per far conoscere all’utente suddetto gli altri prodotti e servizi di STARBOOK che possano riscuotere il suo interesse, ivi inclusi servizi che possano essere oggetto di direct marketing mediante sistemi di messaggistica tramite cellulare e attraverso le notifiche.<br>\\n      2.5. Qualora l’utente non desideri più che i suoi dati siano utilizzati da STARBOOK nei modi sopra indicati o cambi idea riguardo alla possibilità di essere contattato in futuro, si prega di farlo sapere a STARBOOK utilizzando i recapiti indicati al successivo articolo 8 e/o modificando corrispondentemente il proprio profilo.<br>\\n      2.6. Qualora l’utente non desideri più che i suoi dati siano utilizzati da STARBOOK nei modi sopra indicati o cambi idea riguardo alla possibilità di essere contattato in futuro, si prega di opporsi al trattamento nei modi su indicati. In mancanza, è possibile informare in ogni momento farlo sapere a STARBOOK della propria decisione, utilizzando i recapiti indicati al successivo articolo 8 e/o modificando corrispondentemente il proprio profilo.</p>\\n\\n      <h1>Condizioni d'utilizzo</h1>\\n      <p><strong>1. ACCESSO E REGOLAMENTO DEL SITO STARBOOK</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>1.1. Accesso al Sito: </strong>E’ possibile avere accesso ad alcune aree del Sito web anche senza effettuare un Ordine o senza procedere alla registrazione dei propri dati. La maggior parte delle aree del Sito sono accessibili a chiunque.<br>\\n      <strong>1.2. Accettazione del Regolamento del Sito:</strong> La navigazione in qualunque area del Sito comporta l'accettazione del Regolamento del Sito. I visitatori ed utenti del Sito che rifiutino di accettare il Regolamento del Sito sono tenuti a lasciare immediatamente il Sito e non avranno la possibilità di ordinare servizi tramite il Sito stesso.<br>\\n      <strong>1.3. Modifiche al Regolamento del Sito:</strong> STARBOOK ha facoltà di modificare il presente Regolamento del Sito in qualsiasi momento. Occorre pertanto controllare periodicamente il Regolamento del Sito in vigore al momento poiché essa vincola i visitatori e gli utenti del Sito. I visitatori e utenti del Sito sono tenuti al rispetto delle policy e della disciplina in vigore al momento in cui effettuano un Ordine tramite STARBOOK.<br>\\n      <strong>1.4. Responsabilità:</strong> Spetta ai visitatori e utenti del Sito predisporre quanto necessario per avere accesso al Sito stesso. Inoltre, i visitatori e utenti del Sito sono tenuti a garantire che tutti coloro che hanno accesso al Sito tramite la loro connessione ad Internet siano a conoscenza del presente Regolamento del Sito e la rispettino.</p>\\n      <p><strong>2. STATUS DELL’UTENTE DEL SITO STARBOOK</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>2.1. Capacità giuridica ed età: </strong>Effettuando un Ordine tramite il Sito, l’utente garantisce:<br>\\n      <strong>2.1.1.</strong> di aver la capacità di agire e concludere contratti giuridicamente vincolanti<br>\\n      <strong>2.1.2.</strong> di avere compiuto 18 anni</p>\\n      <p><strong>3. MODALITÀ DI EMISSIONE DELL ORDINE E DI ELABORAZIONE DELL’ORDINE</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>3.1. Compilazione dell’Ordine: </strong>Dopo aver selezionato il servizio che intende ordinare da un professionista prescelto dalla piattaforma ed aver fornito le informazioni, l’utente ha facoltà di effettuare l’Ordine cliccando sul, o selezionando il, pulsante “Procedi con l'ordine” e “Procedi con l'acquisto”. Si ricorda che è importante controllare tutte le informazioni immesse e correggere eventuali errori prima di cliccare sul pulsante o di selezionarlo poiché, dopo averlo fatto, il procedimento di elaborazione dell’Ordine ha inizio e non è più possibile correggere eventuali errori.<br>\\n      <strong>3.2. Modifica o annullamento dell’Ordine: </strong>Una volta che l’Ordine è stato inoltrato e il pagamento è stato autorizzato non è più possibile modificare o annullare l’Ordine e non si ha diritto ad alcun rimborso. Ove desideri modificare o annullare l’Ordine, l’utente può rivolgersi al Servizio Clienti, il quale tenterà di contattare il professionista al fine di comunicargli la richiesta dell’utente. Non vi è alcuna assicurazione, tuttavia, riguardo al fatto che il Servizio Clienti sarà in grado di contattare il professionista o che il professionista accetterà le richieste dell’utente in quanto il processo di elaborazione dell’Ordine potrebbe avere già avuto inizio. Il cliente, ai sensi dell'art. 55 lett. a) del Codice del Consumo, non ha diritto a recedere dagli Ordini effettuati una volta che il bene o servizio richiesto è stato consegnato.<br>\\n      <strong>3.3. Autorizzazione al pagamento:</strong> In caso di mancata autorizzazione relativa ad un qualsiasi pagamento, l’Ordine non viene elaborato o non viene comunicato alla piattaforma.<br>\\n      <strong>3.4. Elaborazione dell’Ordine e rifiuto di Ordini da parte del professionista: </strong>Alla ricezione dell’Ordine, STARBOOK ne inizia l’elaborazione con la trasmissione dello stesso ai professionisti interessati e notifica all’utente, tramite sms e mail, che l’Ordine è stato assegnato. Si specifica che qualsiasi pagina di conferma che l’utente possa visualizzare sul Sito e qualsiasi conferma di Ordine che l’utente stesso riceva tramite e-mail indicano esclusivamente che l'Ordine dell’utente è stato assegnato o è in corso. STARBOOK incoraggia tutti i propri professionisti ad accettare tutti gli Ordini ed a comunicare tempestivamente eventuali rifiuti, e comunica all’utente (generalmente tramite e-mail) non appena sia ragionevolmente possibile ogni eventuale rifiuto da parte del professionista. In ogni caso, i professionisti possono scegliere di rifiutare gli Ordini in qualsiasi momento per il fatto di essere eccessivamente impegnati, a causa delle condizioni atmosferiche o per qualsiasi altra ragione.<br>\\n      <strong>3.5. Finitura del servizio:</strong> I tempi stimati per i servizi dal inizio a fine lavori variano tra 1-2 giorni a seconda del tipo di servizio ordinato. STARBOOK e i professionisti non garantiscono che i servizi verranno finiti entro i tempi stimati.</p>\\n      <p><strong>4. PREZZO E PAGAMENTO</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>4.1. IVA e costi di servizio:</strong> I prezzi sono quelli indicati sul Sito. I prezzi sono comprensivi di IVA. Tali costi vengono aggiunti all’importo totale dovuto, se applicabili.<br>\\n      <strong>4.2. Errata indicazione del prezzo:</strong> Il presente Sito web contiene un vasto numero di menu ed è sempre possibile che alcuni di essi possano recare una indicazione inesatta del prezzo. Qualora il prezzo esatto di un Ordine sia più elevato del prezzo indicato sul Sito, STARBOOK normalmente provvede a contattare l’utente prima della spedizione dell'Ordine. In tal caso, né STARBOOK né il professionista interessato hanno alcun obbligo di assicurare che l'Ordine venga fornito all’utente al prezzo inferiore erroneamente indicato né di rimborsare all’utente la differenza rispetto al prezzo errato. In caso il prezzo sia eccessivamente elevato rispetto al prezzo originariamente convenuto e l'utente sia un consumatore ai sensi del Codice del Consumo, l'utente avrà facoltà di recedere dall'Ordine.<br>\\n      <strong>4.3. Modalità di pagamento:</strong> Il pagamento dei servizi deve essere effettuato mediante una carta di credito/debito.<br>\\n      <p><strong>5. SERVIZIO CLIENTI</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>5.1 Disposizioni Generali:</strong> STARBOOK considera il Servizio Clienti estremamente importante. Il Servizio Clienti cerca dunque di prestare assistenza all’utente, quando possibile, in caso di problemi con l'Ordine. L’utente può entrare in contatto con il Servizio Clienti andando sulla pagina help del sito.<br>\\n      <strong>5.2. Modifica o annullamento dell'Ordine:</strong> Ove l’utente desideri modificare o annullare il proprio Ordine dopo che esso sia stata inoltrato e il relativo pagamento autorizzato, l’utente ha facoltà di rivolgersi al Servizio Clienti STARBOOK, con le modalità sopra descritte, il quale tenterà di entrare in contatto con il professionista al fine di comunicare le richieste del cliente. Non vi è alcuna assicurazione, tuttavia, riguardo al fatto che il Servizio Clienti STARBOOK sarà in grado di contattare il professionista o che il professionista accetterà le richieste dell’utente in quanto il processo di elaborazione dell'Ordine potrebbe avere già avuto inizio.<br>\\n      <strong>5.3. Reclami e feedback da parte degli utenti:</strong> Nell’eventualità che l’utente non sia soddisfatto della qualità di un qualsiasi servizio o del servizio fornito da un professionista, STARBOOK invita l’utente a far conoscere la propria opinione tramite il Sito, in forma di valutazioni, commenti e recensioni che riflettano la propria esperienza. Le Recensioni sono una parte importante del processo di controllo qualità di STARBOOK.<br>\\n      <strong>5.4. Risarcimento:</strong> Nell’eventualità che l’utente non sia soddisfatto della qualità di un qualsiasi servizio o del servizio fornito da un professionista e desideri richiedere un rimborso, una riduzione proporzionale del prezzo o qualsiasi altra forma di risarcimento, è tenuto a contattare direttamente il professionista al fine di presentare il proprio reclamo e, se del caso, ad osservare le procedure di reclamo previste dal professionista stesso. Qualora l’utente non sia in grado di contattare il professionista, o qualora il professionista rifiuti di occuparsi del reclamo dell’utente, quest’ultimo può rivolgersi al Servizio Clienti STARBOOK con le modalità sopra descritte entro 48 ore dall’inoltro dell'Ordine e uno dei Consulenti del Servizio Clienti STARBOOK tenterà di contattare il professionista al fine di richiedere un risarcimento per conto dell’utente. Si fa presente che STARBOOK non ha alcun controllo sui professionisti né sulla qualità dei servizi o sul servizio fornito dai professionisti stessi e non è in grado di fornire, né assume alcuna responsabilità o impegno di fornire, alcun risarcimento in favore dell’utente per conto di qualsiasi professionista.</p>\\n      <p><strong>6.
