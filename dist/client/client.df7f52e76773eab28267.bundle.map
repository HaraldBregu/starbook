In effetti tutti gli “artigeni” che ieri erano presenti alla libreria IBS di via Nazionale per raccontare di persona la propria storia <strong>non avevano l’aria del nerd appena uscito da Harvard, ma piuttosto persone armate di una grande passione per il proprio mestiere e di gran spirito d’iniziativa.</strong></p>\\n    <h2 style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\">Le storie di chi ce l’ha fatta</h2>\\n    <p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\">C’era <strong>Luca Carbonelli</strong>, da Napoli: è a capo della torrefazione di famiglia, ed ha capito che se avrebbe usato la Rete, il suo caffè avrebbe oltrepassato i confini regionali. Così lo vende online da circa 10 anni. Anche <strong>Ela Siromascenko</strong>, ha avviato il suo business dalla vendita online: ha messo le proprie creazioni sartoriali in Rete quasi per scherzo. E’ arrivata in Italia dalla Romania con un dottorato in comunicazione, ma quando ha scoperto che i suoi abiti da cerimonia erano molto apprezzati su <strong>Etsy</strong> (la piattaforma dedicata ad artigiani e creativi) ha capito che la moda sarebbe stata la sua strada. Dalle vendite su Etsy, nel 2015 è passata al suo sito personale e ora ha anche <strong>un atelier a Milano</strong> “perché le clienti sono più propense a spendere se l’abito lo indossano”. Ad ogni modo non ha abbandonato il suo primo negozio online: “Ancora oggi gran parte delle vendite all’estero proviene da Etsy”. Poi c’erano i corrieri “ecologici” di <strong>“E adesso pedala”</strong>: una piccola community di biker che ha messo la propria passione per le due ruote a disposizione di un servizio unico in città: trasportano grossi carichi su Roma utilizzando dei cargo. In altre parole aiutano a fare tutti quegli spostamenti per i quali sarebbe necessario un furgoncino, molto più inquinante e costoso. A proposito di traffico: <strong>Simone Angelini</strong> ha raccontato di come ha trovato il sistema per “hackerare” il suo taxi romano, usando un software di sua invenzione che è in grado di calcolare in anticipo il costo della corsa.</p>\\n    <p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><a href=\\\"http://startupitalia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-1.jpg\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-71772 size-full\\\" src=\\\"http://startupitalia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1663\\\" height=\\\"1226\\\" srcset=\\\"http://startupitalia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-1.jpg 1663w, http://startupitalia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-1-300x221.jpg 300w, http://startupitalia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-1-768x566.jpg 768w, http://startupitalia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-1-1024x755.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1663px) 100vw, 1663px\\\"></a></p>\\n    <h2 style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\">L’eccellenza, il filo rosso</h2>\\n    <p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\">La sua e tante altre storie sono raccolte nel libro di Colletti, che racconta come il filo rosso tra tutti gli artigeni sia stato la capacità di sfruttare le nuove tecnologie per<strong> intercettare una determinata community</strong>: il successo delle loro storie è dato anche dal fatto che parlano a <strong>gruppi</strong>&nbsp;ristretti di persone, che quindi diventano <strong>fidelizzate</strong>. E poi, naturalmente, c’è il gusto per l’eccellenza: «Non basta l’idea. Perché per vincere la sfida dei mercati e competere in questi anni liquidi non basta lavorare bene. Occorre farlo al meglio. Bisogna diventare rilevanti ed eccellere». E loro hanno trovato il modo per farlo.</p>\\n    <p style=\\\"text-align: right\\\"><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/carlottabalena\\\">@carlottabalena</a></p>\\n    </div>\\n    </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n\n/***/ 710:\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports = \"<div class=\\\"category-container\\\" *ngIf=\\\"category\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"category-header\\\" [ngStyle]=\\\"{'background-image' : ' url(' + category.image_url + ')'}\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"overlay\\\">\\n      <div class=\\\"header-content\\\">\\n        <h1>{{category.title}}</h1>\\n        <h5>{{category.description}}</h5>\\n        <img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/star.png\\\" alt=\\\"Starbook professionisti\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/star.png\\\" alt=\\\"Starbook professionisti\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/star.png\\\" alt=\\\"Starbook professionisti\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/star.png\\\" alt=\\\"Starbook professionisti\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/star.png\\\" alt=\\\"Starbook professionisti\\\">\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\\\"description-container\\\">\\n    <p>Questo è la descrizione ideale</p>\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n\n/***/ 711:\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports = \"\"\n\n/***/ },\n\n/***/ 712:\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports = \"<div class=\\\"help-container\\\">\\n  <h1>Aiuto e Assistenza</h1>\\n  <p>Per qualsisasi domanda o problema rilevato sulla piattaforma Starbook potete usare i contatti sotto indicati.</p>\\n  <h3>Telefono</h3>\\n  <p>+39 327 24 15 028</p>\\n  <h3>Email</h3>\\n  <p>info@starbook.co</p>\\n  <h3>Social network</h3>\\n  <div class=\\\"list-socials\\\">\\n    <a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/starbook.co/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/facebook.png\\\"></a>\\n    <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/starbookco/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/twitter.png\\\"></a>\\n    <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/starbook.co/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/instagram.png\\\"></a>\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n<footer class=\\\"footer sticky-footer\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"footer-container\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\n      <div class=\\\"col-md-6 col-lg-3\\\">\\n        <ul>\\n          <li>Starbook © 2017</li>\\n          <li>Tutti i diritti riservati</li>\\n        </ul>\\n      </div>\\n      <div class=\\\"col-md-6 col-lg-3\\\">\\n        <ul>\\n          <li><a routerLink=\\\"/legal\\\" routerLinkActive=\\\"active\\\">Privacy e Condizioni</a></li>\\n          <li><a routerLink=\\\"/help\\\" routerLinkActive=\\\"active\\\">Aiuto e Assistenza</a></li>\\n        </ul>\\n      </div>\\n      <div class=\\\"col-md-6 col-lg-3\\\">\\n        <ul>\\n          <li><a routerLink=\\\"/about\\\" routerLinkActive=\\\"active\\\">Chi siamo</a></li>\\n        </ul>\\n      </div>\\n      <div class=\\\"col-md-6 col-lg-3\\\">\\n        <ul>\\n          <li><a routerLink=\\\"/requests/service\\\" routerLinkActive=\\\"active\\\">Richiedi un servizio</a></li>\\n        </ul>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n</footer>\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n\n/***/ 713:\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports = \"<div class=\\\"legal-container\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"legal-content\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"container\\\">\\n      <h1>Privacy policy</h1>\\n      <p><strong>1.

ACCESSO E REGOLAMENTO DEL SITO STARBOOK</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>1.1. Accesso al Sito: </strong>E’ possibile avere accesso ad alcune aree del Sito web anche senza effettuare un Ordine o senza procedere alla registrazione dei propri dati. La maggior parte delle aree del Sito sono accessibili a chiunque.<br>\\n      <strong>1.2. Accettazione del Regolamento del Sito:</strong> La navigazione in qualunque area del Sito comporta l'accettazione del Regolamento del Sito. I visitatori ed utenti del Sito che rifiutino di accettare il Regolamento del Sito sono tenuti a lasciare immediatamente il Sito e non avranno la possibilità di ordinare servizi tramite il Sito stesso.<br>\\n      <strong>1.3. Modifiche al Regolamento del Sito:</strong> STARBOOK ha facoltà di modificare il presente Regolamento del Sito in qualsiasi momento. Occorre pertanto controllare periodicamente il Regolamento del Sito in vigore al momento poiché essa vincola i visitatori e gli utenti del Sito. I visitatori e utenti del Sito sono tenuti al rispetto delle policy e della disciplina in vigore al momento in cui effettuano un Ordine tramite STARBOOK.<br>\\n      <strong>1.4. Responsabilità:</strong> Spetta ai visitatori e utenti del Sito predisporre quanto necessario per avere accesso al Sito stesso. Inoltre, i visitatori e utenti del Sito sono tenuti a garantire che tutti coloro che hanno accesso al Sito tramite la loro connessione ad Internet siano a conoscenza del presente Regolamento del Sito e la rispettino.</p>\\n      <p><strong>2. STATUS DELL’UTENTE DEL SITO STARBOOK</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>2.1. Capacità giuridica ed età: </strong>Effettuando un Ordine tramite il Sito, l’utente garantisce:<br>\\n      <strong>2.1.1.</strong> di aver la capacità di agire e concludere contratti giuridicamente vincolanti<br>\\n      <strong>2.1.2.</strong> di avere compiuto 18 anni</p>\\n      <p><strong>3. MODALITÀ DI EMISSIONE DELL ORDINE E DI ELABORAZIONE DELL’ORDINE</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>3.1. Compilazione dell’Ordine: </strong>Dopo aver selezionato il servizio che intende ordinare da un professionista prescelto dalla piattaforma ed aver fornito le informazioni, l’utente ha facoltà di effettuare l’Ordine cliccando sul, o selezionando il, pulsante “Procedi con l'ordine” e “Procedi con l'acquisto”. Si ricorda che è importante controllare tutte le informazioni immesse e correggere eventuali errori prima di cliccare sul pulsante o di selezionarlo poiché, dopo averlo fatto, il procedimento di elaborazione dell’Ordine ha inizio e non è più possibile correggere eventuali errori.<br>\\n      <strong>3.2. Modifica o annullamento dell’Ordine: </strong>Una volta che l’Ordine è stato inoltrato e il pagamento è stato autorizzato non è più possibile modificare o annullare l’Ordine e non si ha diritto ad alcun rimborso. Ove desideri modificare o annullare l’Ordine, l’utente può rivolgersi al Servizio Clienti, il quale tenterà di contattare il professionista al fine di comunicargli la richiesta dell’utente. Non vi è alcuna assicurazione, tuttavia, riguardo al fatto che il Servizio Clienti sarà in grado di contattare il professionista o che il professionista accetterà le richieste dell’utente in quanto il processo di elaborazione dell’Ordine potrebbe avere già avuto inizio. Il cliente, ai sensi dell'art. 55 lett. a) del Codice del Consumo, non ha diritto a recedere dagli Ordini effettuati una volta che il bene o servizio richiesto è stato consegnato.<br>\\n      <strong>3.3. Autorizzazione al pagamento:</strong> In caso di mancata autorizzazione relativa ad un qualsiasi pagamento, l’Ordine non viene elaborato o non viene comunicato alla piattaforma.<br>\\n      <strong>3.4. Elaborazione dell’Ordine e rifiuto di Ordini da parte del professionista: </strong>Alla ricezione dell’Ordine, STARBOOK ne inizia l’elaborazione con la trasmissione dello stesso ai professionisti interessati e notifica all’utente, tramite sms e mail, che l’Ordine è stato assegnato. Si specifica che qualsiasi pagina di conferma che l’utente possa visualizzare sul Sito e qualsiasi conferma di Ordine che l’utente stesso riceva tramite e-mail indicano esclusivamente che l'Ordine dell’utente è stato assegnato o è in corso. STARBOOK incoraggia tutti i propri professionisti ad accettare tutti gli Ordini ed a comunicare tempestivamente eventuali rifiuti, e comunica all’utente (generalmente tramite e-mail) non appena sia ragionevolmente possibile ogni eventuale rifiuto da parte del professionista. In ogni caso, i professionisti possono scegliere di rifiutare gli Ordini in qualsiasi momento per il fatto di essere eccessivamente impegnati, a causa delle condizioni atmosferiche o per qualsiasi altra ragione.<br>\\n      <strong>3.5. Finitura del servizio:</strong> I tempi stimati per i servizi dal inizio a fine lavori variano tra 1-2 giorni a seconda del tipo di servizio ordinato. STARBOOK e i professionisti non garantiscono che i servizi verranno finiti entro i tempi stimati.</p>\\n      <p><strong>4. PREZZO E PAGAMENTO</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>4.1. IVA e costi di servizio:</strong> I prezzi sono quelli indicati sul Sito. I prezzi sono comprensivi di IVA. Tali costi vengono aggiunti all’importo totale dovuto, se applicabili.<br>\\n      <strong>4.2. Errata indicazione del prezzo:</strong> Il presente Sito web contiene un vasto numero di menu ed è sempre possibile che alcuni di essi possano recare una indicazione inesatta del prezzo. Qualora il prezzo esatto di un Ordine sia più elevato del prezzo indicato sul Sito, STARBOOK normalmente provvede a contattare l’utente prima della spedizione dell'Ordine. In tal caso, né STARBOOK né il professionista interessato hanno alcun obbligo di assicurare che l'Ordine venga fornito all’utente al prezzo inferiore erroneamente indicato né di rimborsare all’utente la differenza rispetto al prezzo errato. In caso il prezzo sia eccessivamente elevato rispetto al prezzo originariamente convenuto e l'utente sia un consumatore ai sensi del Codice del Consumo, l'utente avrà facoltà di recedere dall'Ordine.<br>\\n      <strong>4.3. Modalità di pagamento:</strong> Il pagamento dei servizi deve essere effettuato mediante una carta di credito/debito.<br>\\n      <p><strong>5. SERVIZIO CLIENTI</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>5.1 Disposizioni Generali:</strong> STARBOOK considera il Servizio Clienti estremamente importante. Il Servizio Clienti cerca dunque di prestare assistenza all’utente, quando possibile, in caso di problemi con l'Ordine. L’utente può entrare in contatto con il Servizio Clienti andando sulla pagina help del sito.<br>\\n      <strong>5.2. Modifica o annullamento dell'Ordine:</strong> Ove l’utente desideri modificare o annullare il proprio Ordine dopo che esso sia stata inoltrato e il relativo pagamento autorizzato, l’utente ha facoltà di rivolgersi al Servizio Clienti STARBOOK, con le modalità sopra descritte, il quale tenterà di entrare in contatto con il professionista al fine di comunicare le richieste del cliente. Non vi è alcuna assicurazione, tuttavia, riguardo al fatto che il Servizio Clienti STARBOOK sarà in grado di contattare il professionista o che il professionista accetterà le richieste dell’utente in quanto il processo di elaborazione dell'Ordine potrebbe avere già avuto inizio.<br>\\n      <strong>5.3. Reclami e feedback da parte degli utenti:</strong> Nell’eventualità che l’utente non sia soddisfatto della qualità di un qualsiasi servizio o del servizio fornito da un professionista, STARBOOK invita l’utente a far conoscere la propria opinione tramite il Sito, in forma di valutazioni, commenti e recensioni che riflettano la propria esperienza. Le Recensioni sono una parte importante del processo di controllo qualità di STARBOOK.<br>\\n      <strong>5.4. Risarcimento:</strong> Nell’eventualità che l’utente non sia soddisfatto della qualità di un qualsiasi servizio o del servizio fornito da un professionista e desideri richiedere un rimborso, una riduzione proporzionale del prezzo o qualsiasi altra forma di risarcimento, è tenuto a contattare direttamente il professionista al fine di presentare il proprio reclamo e, se del caso, ad osservare le procedure di reclamo previste dal professionista stesso. Qualora l’utente non sia in grado di contattare il professionista, o qualora il professionista rifiuti di occuparsi del reclamo dell’utente, quest’ultimo può rivolgersi al Servizio Clienti STARBOOK con le modalità sopra descritte entro 48 ore dall’inoltro dell'Ordine e uno dei Consulenti del Servizio Clienti STARBOOK tenterà di contattare il professionista al fine di richiedere un risarcimento per conto dell’utente. Si fa presente che STARBOOK non ha alcun controllo sui professionisti né sulla qualità dei servizi o sul servizio fornito dai professionisti stessi e non è in grado di fornire, né assume alcuna responsabilità o impegno di fornire, alcun risarcimento in favore dell’utente per conto di qualsiasi professionista.</p>\\n      <p><strong>6.

In effetti tutti gli “artigeni” che ieri erano presenti alla libreria IBS di via Nazionale per raccontare di persona la propria storia <strong>non avevano l’aria del nerd appena uscito da Harvard, ma piuttosto persone armate di una grande passione per il proprio mestiere e di gran spirito d’iniziativa.</strong></p>\\n    <h2 style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\">Le storie di chi ce l’ha fatta</h2>\\n    <p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\">C’era <strong>Luca Carbonelli</strong>, da Napoli: è a capo della torrefazione di famiglia, ed ha capito che se avrebbe usato la Rete, il suo caffè avrebbe oltrepassato i confini regionali. Così lo vende online da circa 10 anni. Anche <strong>Ela Siromascenko</strong>, ha avviato il suo business dalla vendita online: ha messo le proprie creazioni sartoriali in Rete quasi per scherzo. E’ arrivata in Italia dalla Romania con un dottorato in comunicazione, ma quando ha scoperto che i suoi abiti da cerimonia erano molto apprezzati su <strong>Etsy</strong> (la piattaforma dedicata ad artigiani e creativi) ha capito che la moda sarebbe stata la sua strada. Dalle vendite su Etsy, nel 2015 è passata al suo sito personale e ora ha anche <strong>un atelier a Milano</strong> “perché le clienti sono più propense a spendere se l’abito lo indossano”. Ad ogni modo non ha abbandonato il suo primo negozio online: “Ancora oggi gran parte delle vendite all’estero proviene da Etsy”. Poi c’erano i corrieri “ecologici” di <strong>“E adesso pedala”</strong>: una piccola community di biker che ha messo la propria passione per le due ruote a disposizione di un servizio unico in città: trasportano grossi carichi su Roma utilizzando dei cargo. In altre parole aiutano a fare tutti quegli spostamenti per i quali sarebbe necessario un furgoncino, molto più inquinante e costoso. A proposito di traffico: <strong>Simone Angelini</strong> ha raccontato di come ha trovato il sistema per “hackerare” il suo taxi romano, usando un software di sua invenzione che è in grado di calcolare in anticipo il costo della corsa.</p>\\n    <p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><a href=\\\"http://startupitalia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-1.jpg\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-71772 size-full\\\" src=\\\"http://startupitalia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1663\\\" height=\\\"1226\\\" srcset=\\\"http://startupitalia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-1.jpg 1663w, http://startupitalia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-1-300x221.jpg 300w, http://startupitalia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-1-768x566.jpg 768w, http://startupitalia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-1-1024x755.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1663px) 100vw, 1663px\\\"></a></p>\\n    <h2 style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\">L’eccellenza, il filo rosso</h2>\\n    <p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\">La sua e tante altre storie sono raccolte nel libro di Colletti, che racconta come il filo rosso tra tutti gli artigeni sia stato la capacità di sfruttare le nuove tecnologie per<strong> intercettare una determinata community</strong>: il successo delle loro storie è dato anche dal fatto che parlano a <strong>gruppi</strong>&nbsp;ristretti di persone, che quindi diventano <strong>fidelizzate</strong>. E poi, naturalmente, c’è il gusto per l’eccellenza: «Non basta l’idea. Perché per vincere la sfida dei mercati e competere in questi anni liquidi non basta lavorare bene. Occorre farlo al meglio. Bisogna diventare rilevanti ed eccellere». E loro hanno trovato il modo per farlo.</p>\\n    <p style=\\\"text-align: right\\\"><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/carlottabalena\\\">@carlottabalena</a></p>\\n    </div>\\n    </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/pages/blog/blog.component.html\n// module id = 709\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<div class=\\\"category-container\\\" *ngIf=\\\"category\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"category-header\\\" [ngStyle]=\\\"{'background-image' : ' url(' + category.image_url + ')'}\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"overlay\\\">\\n      <div class=\\\"header-content\\\">\\n        <h1>{{category.title}}</h1>\\n        <h5>{{category.description}}</h5>\\n        <img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/star.png\\\" alt=\\\"Starbook professionisti\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/star.png\\\" alt=\\\"Starbook professionisti\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/star.png\\\" alt=\\\"Starbook professionisti\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/star.png\\\" alt=\\\"Starbook professionisti\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/star.png\\\" alt=\\\"Starbook professionisti\\\">\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\\\"description-container\\\">\\n    <p>Questo è la descrizione ideale</p>\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/pages/category/category.component.html\n// module id = 710\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/pages/facebook/facebook.component.html\n// module id = 711\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<div class=\\\"help-container\\\">\\n  <h1>Aiuto e Assistenza</h1>\\n  <p>Per qualsisasi domanda o problema rilevato sulla piattaforma Starbook potete usare i contatti sotto indicati.</p>\\n  <h3>Telefono</h3>\\n  <p>+39 327 24 15 028</p>\\n  <h3>Email</h3>\\n  <p>info@starbook.co</p>\\n  <h3>Social network</h3>\\n  <div class=\\\"list-socials\\\">\\n    <a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/starbook.co/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/facebook.png\\\"></a>\\n    <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/starbookco/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/twitter.png\\\"></a>\\n    <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/starbook.co/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img src=\\\"../../../assets/images/instagram.png\\\"></a>\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n<footer class=\\\"footer sticky-footer\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"footer-container\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\n      <div class=\\\"col-md-6 col-lg-3\\\">\\n        <ul>\\n          <li>Starbook © 2017</li>\\n          <li>Tutti i diritti riservati</li>\\n        </ul>\\n      </div>\\n      <div class=\\\"col-md-6 col-lg-3\\\">\\n        <ul>\\n          <li><a routerLink=\\\"/legal\\\" routerLinkActive=\\\"active\\\">Privacy e Condizioni</a></li>\\n          <li><a routerLink=\\\"/help\\\" routerLinkActive=\\\"active\\\">Aiuto e Assistenza</a></li>\\n        </ul>\\n      </div>\\n      <div class=\\\"col-md-6 col-lg-3\\\">\\n        <ul>\\n          <li><a routerLink=\\\"/about\\\" routerLinkActive=\\\"active\\\">Chi siamo</a></li>\\n        </ul>\\n      </div>\\n      <div class=\\\"col-md-6 col-lg-3\\\">\\n        <ul>\\n          <li><a routerLink=\\\"/requests/service\\\" routerLinkActive=\\\"active\\\">Richiedi un servizio</a></li>\\n        </ul>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n</footer>\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/pages/help/help.component.html\n// module id = 712\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<div class=\\\"legal-container\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"legal-content\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"container\\\">\\n      <h1>Privacy policy</h1>\\n      <p><strong>1.

Ad esempio, STARBOOK e/o il professionista possono utilizzare i dati dell’utente per fornire allo stesso aggiornamenti sullo stato dell'Ordine o altre informazioni relative alla stessa mediante e-mail, per telefono fisso o mobile o tramite messaggistica mobile. Inoltre, STARBOOK utilizza ed analizza le informazioni raccolte al fine di gestire, sostenere, migliorare e sviluppare la propria attività imprenditoriale, per eventuali altre finalità statistiche o analitiche nonché per contribuire alla prevenzione di frodi. Nei casi in cui sia opportuno, ora e in futuro, l’utente potrebbe avere la capacità di esprimere le proprie preferenze riguardo all’utilizzo dei propri dati secondo quanto previsto nella presente Informativa in materia di Privacy e di esercitarla tramite la metodologia prescelta dall’utente per l’utilizzo del Servizio, ad esempio, in modalità mobile, tramite applicazioni mobili o l’eventuale rappresentazione del Sito.<br>\\n      2.2.

STARBOOK potrà utilizzare l’indirizzo email fornito dall’utente del Sito al momento dell’acquisto di prodotti in vendita sul Sito per far conoscere allo stesso utente i prodotti e servizi di STARBOOK, simili a quelli già acquistati, che possano riscuotere il suo interesse. L’utente potrà in ogni momento, gratuitamente e con effetto immediato opporsi all’utilizzo del proprio indirizzo email per la ricezione di tale materiale informativo cliccando sull’apposito link inserito in calce a ciascuna email ricevuta. In alternativa, l’utente potrà opporsi a tale trattamento anche modificando le preferenze dalla relativa sezione del proprio profilo. Per gestire le notifiche, l’utente dovrà accedere alla pagina delle impostazioni del suo telefono o tablet e modificare l'autorizzazione alle notifiche per l'applicazione STARBOOK. In caso di disattivazione delle notifiche, l’utente non potrà più ricevere aggiornamenti sui suoi ordini via notifiche.<br>\\n      2.4. Se consentito dall’utente del Sito, STARBOOK potrà utilizzare i dati per far conoscere all’utente suddetto gli altri prodotti e servizi di STARBOOK che possano riscuotere il suo interesse, ivi inclusi servizi che possano essere oggetto di direct marketing mediante sistemi di messaggistica tramite cellulare e attraverso le notifiche.<br>\\n      2.5.

ACCESSO E REGOLAMENTO DEL SITO STARBOOK</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>1.1. Accesso al Sito: </strong>E’ possibile avere accesso ad alcune aree del Sito web anche senza effettuare un Ordine o senza procedere alla registrazione dei propri dati. La maggior parte delle aree del Sito sono accessibili a chiunque.<br>\\n      <strong>1.2. Accettazione del Regolamento del Sito:</strong> La navigazione in qualunque area del Sito comporta l'accettazione del Regolamento del Sito. I visitatori ed utenti del Sito che rifiutino di accettare il Regolamento del Sito sono tenuti a lasciare immediatamente il Sito e non avranno la possibilità di ordinare servizi tramite il Sito stesso.<br>\\n      <strong>1.3. Modifiche al Regolamento del Sito:</strong> STARBOOK ha facoltà di modificare il presente Regolamento del Sito in qualsiasi momento. Occorre pertanto controllare periodicamente il Regolamento del Sito in vigore al momento poiché essa vincola i visitatori e gli utenti del Sito. I visitatori e utenti del Sito sono tenuti al rispetto delle policy e della disciplina in vigore al momento in cui effettuano un Ordine tramite STARBOOK.<br>\\n      <strong>1.4. Responsabilità:</strong> Spetta ai visitatori e utenti del Sito predisporre quanto necessario per avere accesso al Sito stesso. Inoltre, i visitatori e utenti del Sito sono tenuti a garantire che tutti coloro che hanno accesso al Sito tramite la loro connessione ad Internet siano a conoscenza del presente Regolamento del Sito e la rispettino.</p>\\n      <p><strong>2. STATUS DELL’UTENTE DEL SITO STARBOOK</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>2.1. Capacità giuridica ed età: </strong>Effettuando un Ordine tramite il Sito, l’utente garantisce:<br>\\n      <strong>2.1.1.</strong> di aver la capacità di agire e concludere contratti giuridicamente vincolanti<br>\\n      <strong>2.1.2.</strong> di avere compiuto 18 anni</p>\\n      <p><strong>3. MODALITÀ DI EMISSIONE DELL ORDINE E DI ELABORAZIONE DELL’ORDINE</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>3.1. Compilazione dell’Ordine: </strong>Dopo aver selezionato il servizio che intende ordinare da un professionista prescelto dalla piattaforma ed aver fornito le informazioni, l’utente ha facoltà di effettuare l’Ordine cliccando sul, o selezionando il, pulsante “Procedi con l'ordine” e “Procedi con l'acquisto”. Si ricorda che è importante controllare tutte le informazioni immesse e correggere eventuali errori prima di cliccare sul pulsante o di selezionarlo poiché, dopo averlo fatto, il procedimento di elaborazione dell’Ordine ha inizio e non è più possibile correggere eventuali errori.<br>\\n      <strong>3.2. Modifica o annullamento dell’Ordine: </strong>Una volta che l’Ordine è stato inoltrato e il pagamento è stato autorizzato non è più possibile modificare o annullare l’Ordine e non si ha diritto ad alcun rimborso. Ove desideri modificare o annullare l’Ordine, l’utente può rivolgersi al Servizio Clienti, il quale tenterà di contattare il professionista al fine di comunicargli la richiesta dell’utente. Non vi è alcuna assicurazione, tuttavia, riguardo al fatto che il Servizio Clienti sarà in grado di contattare il professionista o che il professionista accetterà le richieste dell’utente in quanto il processo di elaborazione dell’Ordine potrebbe avere già avuto inizio. Il cliente, ai sensi dell'art. 55 lett. a) del Codice del Consumo, non ha diritto a recedere dagli Ordini effettuati una volta che il bene o servizio richiesto è stato consegnato.<br>\\n      <strong>3.3. Autorizzazione al pagamento:</strong> In caso di mancata autorizzazione relativa ad un qualsiasi pagamento, l’Ordine non viene elaborato o non viene comunicato alla piattaforma.<br>\\n      <strong>3.4. Elaborazione dell’Ordine e rifiuto di Ordini da parte del professionista: </strong>Alla ricezione dell’Ordine, STARBOOK ne inizia l’elaborazione con la trasmissione dello stesso ai professionisti interessati e notifica all’utente, tramite sms e mail, che l’Ordine è stato assegnato. Si specifica che qualsiasi pagina di conferma che l’utente possa visualizzare sul Sito e qualsiasi conferma di Ordine che l’utente stesso riceva tramite e-mail indicano esclusivamente che l'Ordine dell’utente è stato assegnato o è in corso. STARBOOK incoraggia tutti i propri professionisti ad accettare tutti gli Ordini ed a comunicare tempestivamente eventuali rifiuti, e comunica all’utente (generalmente tramite e-mail) non appena sia ragionevolmente possibile ogni eventuale rifiuto da parte del professionista. In ogni caso, i professionisti possono scegliere di rifiutare gli Ordini in qualsiasi momento per il fatto di essere eccessivamente impegnati, a causa delle condizioni atmosferiche o per qualsiasi altra ragione.<br>\\n      <strong>3.5. Finitura del servizio:</strong> I tempi stimati per i servizi dal inizio a fine lavori variano tra 1-2 giorni a seconda del tipo di servizio ordinato. STARBOOK e i professionisti non garantiscono che i servizi verranno finiti entro i tempi stimati.</p>\\n      <p><strong>4. PREZZO E PAGAMENTO</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>4.1. IVA e costi di servizio:</strong> I prezzi sono quelli indicati sul Sito. I prezzi sono comprensivi di IVA. Tali costi vengono aggiunti all’importo totale dovuto, se applicabili.<br>\\n      <strong>4.2. Errata indicazione del prezzo:</strong> Il presente Sito web contiene un vasto numero di menu ed è sempre possibile che alcuni di essi possano recare una indicazione inesatta del prezzo. Qualora il prezzo esatto di un Ordine sia più elevato del prezzo indicato sul Sito, STARBOOK normalmente provvede a contattare l’utente prima della spedizione dell'Ordine. In tal caso, né STARBOOK né il professionista interessato hanno alcun obbligo di assicurare che l'Ordine venga fornito all’utente al prezzo inferiore erroneamente indicato né di rimborsare all’utente la differenza rispetto al prezzo errato. In caso il prezzo sia eccessivamente elevato rispetto al prezzo originariamente convenuto e l'utente sia un consumatore ai sensi del Codice del Consumo, l'utente avrà facoltà di recedere dall'Ordine.<br>\\n      <strong>4.3. Modalità di pagamento:</strong> Il pagamento dei servizi deve essere effettuato mediante una carta di credito/debito.<br>\\n      <p><strong>5. SERVIZIO CLIENTI</strong></p>\\n      <p><strong>5.1 Disposizioni Generali:</strong> STARBOOK considera il Servizio Clienti estremamente importante. Il Servizio Clienti cerca dunque di prestare assistenza all’utente, quando possibile, in caso di problemi con l'Ordine. L’utente può entrare in contatto con il Servizio Clienti andando sulla pagina help del sito.<br>\\n      <strong>5.2. Modifica o annullamento dell'Ordine:</strong> Ove l’utente desideri modificare o annullare il proprio Ordine dopo che esso sia stata inoltrato e il relativo pagamento autorizzato, l’utente ha facoltà di rivolgersi al Servizio Clienti STARBOOK, con le modalità sopra descritte, il quale tenterà di entrare in contatto con il professionista al fine di comunicare le richieste del cliente. Non vi è alcuna assicurazione, tuttavia, riguardo al fatto che il Servizio Clienti STARBOOK sarà in grado di contattare il professionista o che il professionista accetterà le richieste dell’utente in quanto il processo di elaborazione dell'Ordine potrebbe avere già avuto inizio.<br>\\n      <strong>5.3. Reclami e feedback da parte degli utenti:</strong> Nell’eventualità che l’utente non sia soddisfatto della qualità di un qualsiasi servizio o del servizio fornito da un professionista, STARBOOK invita l’utente a far conoscere la propria opinione tramite il Sito, in forma di valutazioni, commenti e recensioni che riflettano la propria esperienza. Le Recensioni sono una parte importante del processo di controllo qualità di STARBOOK.<br>\\n      <strong>5.4. Risarcimento:</strong> Nell’eventualità che l’utente non sia soddisfatto della qualità di un qualsiasi servizio o del servizio fornito da un professionista e desideri richiedere un rimborso, una riduzione proporzionale del prezzo o qualsiasi altra forma di risarcimento, è tenuto a contattare direttamente il professionista al fine di presentare il proprio reclamo e, se del caso, ad osservare le procedure di reclamo previste dal professionista stesso. Qualora l’utente non sia in grado di contattare il professionista, o qualora il professionista rifiuti di occuparsi del reclamo dell’utente, quest’ultimo può rivolgersi al Servizio Clienti STARBOOK con le modalità sopra descritte entro 48 ore dall’inoltro dell'Ordine e uno dei Consulenti del Servizio Clienti STARBOOK tenterà di contattare il professionista al fine di richiedere un risarcimento per conto dell’utente. Si fa presente che STARBOOK non ha alcun controllo sui professionisti né sulla qualità dei servizi o sul servizio fornito dai professionisti stessi e non è in grado di fornire, né assume alcuna responsabilità o impegno di fornire, alcun risarcimento in favore dell’utente per conto di qualsiasi professionista.</p>\\n      <p><strong>6.
