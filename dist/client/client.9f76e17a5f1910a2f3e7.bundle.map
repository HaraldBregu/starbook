Ti iscrivi come impresa, inserisci la P.IVA, selezioni la tua professione e inizi a ricevere offerte di lavoro. Ogni volta che c\\u2019\\u00E8 una nuova richiesta di preventivo ti arriva una notifica email e un SMS. A quel punto decidi di comprare il contatto e d\\u2019inviarli un preventivo. I prezzi variano dai 5 ai 20\\u20AC per ogni preventivo o contatto acquistato. Dal altra parte il cliente riceve fino a 5 preventivi da altri professionisti e imprese che hanno acquistato il contatto come te.</p>\\n        </section>\\n        <section>\\n          <h2>Problema</h2>\\n          <p>Analizziamo i vantaggi e svantaggi. Questi sistemi sono ottimi per trovare contatti e trasformarli in clienti, ma non \\u00E8 detto che il contatto sia reale o veramente interessato. Facendo due conti per ogni preventivo solo 1 su 5 delle imprese vince il lavoro. Quindi in media dovresti fare 5 preventivi per vincere uno. Non solo vincerlo ma anche assicurarti che il cliente sia regolare, che non cambi idea al ultimo minuto \\u00E8 che abbia chiaro la data del inizio dei lavori. Riassumendo in punti i problemi sono:</p>\\n          <ul>\\n            <li><strong>Nessuna garanzia di lavoro</strong></li>\\n            <li><strong>Alto tasso d'insuccesso</strong></li>\\n            <li><strong>Clienti non interessati</strong></li>\\n            <li><strong>Molta concorrenza</strong></li>\\n            <li><strong>Facilmente adatto alle truffe</strong></li>\\n          </ul>\\n        </section>\\n        <section>\\n          <h2>Soluzione</h2>\\n          <p>La soluzione non \\u00E8 standard per tutte le imprese che acquistano contatti online.

Ecco quali sono i 3 modi che puoi seguire per utilizzarlo in modo saggio:</p>\\n        <section>\\n          <h2>1. Gli annunci</h2>\\n          <p>Scontato come opzione ma sottovalutato da molti. Ci sono <strong>decina</strong> di siti di annunci disponibili in Italia da anni ormai dove puoi inserire la tua azienda, la tua professione o quello che offri. Siti come <a href=\\\"http://www.subito.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Subito</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.bakeca.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Bakeca</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.kijiji.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Kijiji</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.secondamano.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Secondamano</a> e molte altre. Abbiamo anche i social network come Facebook con i gruppi professionali dove puoi semplicemente iscriverti e pubblicare il tuo annuncio a un pubblico selezionato e mirato.</p>\\n          <p>Gli annunci anche se un metodo classico di promozione per alcuni professionisti funzionano ancora, ma di certo <strong>esiste di meglio</strong>.</p>\\n        </section>\\n        <section>\\n          <h2>2. Le piattaforme</h2>\\n          <p>Poi ci sono le piattaforme di servizi locali adatte ai professionisti che vogliono avere un rapporto diretto con il potenziale cliente. Potenziale cliente perch\\u00E9 queste piattaforme funzionano tramite l\\u2019acquisto di un contatto (il cliente). Dopo l\\u2019acquisto \\u00E8 nelle mani del professionista puntare sulla comunicazione e sul prezzo per convertire il contatto in un cliente.</p>\\n          <p>Tuttavia alcune di queste piattaforme partono con un piano gratuito, altre con un periodo di prova e altre sono a pagamento per sempre. Per elencare alcune: <a href=\\\"https://www.prontopro.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ProntoPro</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.fazland.com/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Fazland</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.habitissimo.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Habitissimo</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.instapro.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Instapro</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.preventivi.it/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Preventivi</a> e molte altre.</p>\\n          <p>Le scelte attuali di un professionista sono queste ma non \\u00E8 detto che non si possa trovare o fare di meglio.</p>\\n        </section>\\n        <section>\\n          <h2>3. Pubblicit\\u00E0 online</h2>\\n          <p>La pubblicit\\u00E0 online invece \\u00E8 un altro metodo valido per poter promuovere la propria attivit\\u00E0 e acquisire nuovi clienti. Diversamente dagli altri modi questo dipende sia dal tuo annuncio, dal prezzo che spendi per l\\u2019annuncio e dalla tua comunicazione.</p>\\n          <p>Uno strumento semplice da utilizzare se sei confidente con il web e relativamente economico si chiama <a href=\\\"https://adwords.google.com/express/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Google Adwords Express</a>.</p>\\n          <p>Un altro strumento \\u00E8 <a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/business\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Facebook Ads</a> che \\u00E8 leggermente pi\\u00F9 complessa ma vale la pena

Basta collegarsi alla piattaforma scelta, inserire il tipo di servizio desiderato e la data in cui si desidera godere di quel determinato servizio e avviare la ricerca. In pochi secondi, sar\\u00E0 possibile visualizzare le diverse offerte disponibili e prenotare direttamente l'intervento desiderato.</p>\\n          <p>Facile intuire il motivo di tanto apprezzamento da parte degli utilizzatori di questo servizio: oltre alla gi\\u00E0 citata semplicit\\u00E0 di utilizzo e ai prezzi convenienti, a rassicurare coloro che scelgono i servizi di booking on line \\u00E8 la selezione dei professionisti che si appoggiano a queste piattaforme. Lo staff, infatti, garantisce che ogni addetto viene scelto per la sua capacit\\u00E0 di rispondere alle richieste della clientela, rispettando obblighi di legge e standard elevati.

Adesso i consumatori sono più fiduciari nei sistemi digitali. Comprano, prenotano senza avere il timore di essere truffati. Il web stesso è più sicuro che mai, le transazioni sono più sicure.

Tuttavia ci sono cose che devi conoscere prima di iniziare ad utilizzarli e prima di spendere soldi inutilmente.</p>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Il funzionamento</h2>\n          <p>Come abbiamo già parlato anche in un <a href=\"/blog/Gli-artigiani-del-web%3A-3-semplici-modi-per-aumentare-i-clienti-online\" target=\"_blank\">altro articolo</a> su come aumentare i clienti online, il funzionamento di questi siti è semplice. Ti iscrivi come impresa, inserisci la P.IVA, selezioni la tua professione e inizi a ricevere offerte di lavoro. Ogni volta che c’è una nuova richiesta di preventivo ti arriva una notifica email e un SMS. A quel punto decidi di comprare il contatto e d’inviarli un preventivo. I prezzi variano dai 5 ai 20€ per ogni preventivo o contatto acquistato. Dal altra parte il cliente riceve fino a 5 preventivi da altri professionisti e imprese che hanno acquistato il contatto come te.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Problema</h2>\n          <p>Analizziamo i vantaggi e svantaggi. Questi sistemi sono ottimi per trovare contatti e trasformarli in clienti, ma non è detto che il contatto sia reale o veramente interessato. Facendo due conti per ogni preventivo solo 1 su 5 delle imprese vince il lavoro. Quindi in media dovresti fare 5 preventivi per vincere uno. Non solo vincerlo ma anche assicurarti che il cliente sia regolare, che non cambi idea al ultimo minuto è che abbia chiaro la data del inizio dei lavori. Riassumendo in punti i problemi sono:</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li><strong>Nessuna garanzia di lavoro</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Alto tasso d'insuccesso</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Clienti non interessati</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Molta concorrenza</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Facilmente adatto alle truffe</strong></li>\n          </ul>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Soluzione</h2>\n          <p>La soluzione non è standard per tutte le imprese che acquistano contatti online. Si potrebbero trovare centinaia di soluzioni validi, ma visto che i sistemi di cui parliamo sono online, le soluzioni si focalizzano in quel contesto. In sintesi le soluzioni sono:</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li><strong>Verifica dei contatti acquistati</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Controllare l'interessamento del cliente</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Inviare email professionali</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Inviare SMS professionali</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Aumentare il successo dei preventivi online</strong></li>\n            <li><strong>Diventare competitivi</strong></li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>Questi sono delle soluzioni validi per verificare i vostri clienti, crescere il successo dei preventivi, chiedere rimborsi e ovviamente crescere i guadagni.</p>\n          <p><a href=\"https://www.starbook.co/company/promotions\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/starbook-s3/blog/starbook-promotion-ads.png\" alt=\"Pubblicità online starbook\" title=\"Pubblicità online starbook\"/></a></p>\n        </section>\n      </article>\n      `\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\" : \"Gli artigiani del web: 3 semplici modi per aumentare i clienti online\",\n      \"subtitle\" : \"Hai un attività professionale, sei artigiano, idraulico, elettricista o altro e vuoi utilizzare il web per aumentare la tua clientela?

Ecco quali sono i 3 modi che puoi seguire per utilizzarlo in modo saggio:</p>\n        <section>\n          <h2>1. Gli annunci</h2>\n          <p>Scontato come opzione ma sottovalutato da molti. Ci sono <strong>decina</strong> di siti di annunci disponibili in Italia da anni ormai dove puoi inserire la tua azienda, la tua professione o quello che offri. Siti come <a href=\"http://www.subito.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Subito</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bakeca.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bakeca</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kijiji.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Kijiji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.secondamano.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Secondamano</a> e molte altre. Abbiamo anche i social network come Facebook con i gruppi professionali dove puoi semplicemente iscriverti e pubblicare il tuo annuncio a un pubblico selezionato e mirato.</p>\n          <p>Gli annunci anche se un metodo classico di promozione per alcuni professionisti funzionano ancora, ma di certo <strong>esiste di meglio</strong>.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h2>2. Le piattaforme</h2>\n          <p>Poi ci sono le piattaforme di servizi locali adatte ai professionisti che vogliono avere un rapporto diretto con il potenziale cliente. Potenziale cliente perché queste piattaforme funzionano tramite l’acquisto di un contatto (il cliente). Dopo l’acquisto è nelle mani del professionista puntare sulla comunicazione e sul prezzo per convertire il contatto in un cliente.</p>\n          <p>Tuttavia alcune di queste piattaforme partono con un piano gratuito, altre con un periodo di prova e altre sono a pagamento per sempre. Per elencare alcune: <a href=\"https://www.prontopro.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ProntoPro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fazland.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Fazland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.habitissimo.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Habitissimo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instapro.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Instapro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.preventivi.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Preventivi</a> e molte altre.</p>\n          <p>Le scelte attuali di un professionista sono queste ma non è detto che non si possa trovare o fare di meglio.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h2>3. Pubblicità online</h2>\n          <p>La pubblicità online invece è un altro metodo valido per poter promuovere la propria attività e acquisire nuovi clienti. Diversamente dagli altri modi questo dipende sia dal tuo annuncio, dal prezzo che spendi per l’annuncio e dalla tua comunicazione.</p>\n          <p>Uno strumento semplice da utilizzare se sei confidente con il web e relativamente economico si chiama <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/express/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google Adwords Express</a>.</p>\n          <p>Un altro strumento è <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Ads</a> che è leggermente più complessa ma vale la pena provare.</p>\n          <p><a

<h2>Perché adattarsi alla nuova era digitale</h2>\n          <p>L’economia on demand è l’acquisto di quel particolare bene materiale o prestazione occasionale solo quando hai bisogno senza sprecare tempo. Infatti solo quando hai bisogno di un passaggio in auto chiami un Uber. Quando vuoi mangiare a pranzo, te lo fai portare da Deliveroo, Foodora, JustEat. Quando devi fare delle commissioni, utilizzi Jobby o Vicker che sono nate in Italia negli ultimi mesi. Ce persino l’app dei traslochi Traslochino che ti connette con persone che ti possono aiutare a fare il trasloco.</p>\n          <p>Perché non adattarsi se per ogni esigenza o un problema esiste una piattaforma che ti fa risparmiare tempo?</p>\n          <p>Potremmo semplicemente dire che viviamo non più nell’era d'internet ma delle piattaforme on demand.

Ormai da qualche tempo, infatti, il web si è popolato di piattaforme per la prenotazione di servizi che promettono ai loro utilizzatori notevoli vantaggi in termini non soltanto di tempo, ma anche di denaro: sconti dedicati, professionisti a completa disposizione della clientela e uno staff in grado di garantire il suo supporto sono stati i punti a favore di questo nuovo fenomeno che, stando ad alcune statistiche, sembra destinato ad espandersi. Scopriamo come funziona il booking dei servizi e perché è tanto apprezzato.</p>\n        <section>\n          <h2>Come funziona e perché ha riscosso tanto successo</h2>\n          <p>Il funzionamento dei sistemi di booking on line è in realtà più semplice di quanto si potrebbe pensare. Basta collegarsi alla piattaforma scelta, inserire il tipo di servizio desiderato e la data in cui si desidera godere di quel determinato servizio e avviare la ricerca. In pochi secondi, sarà possibile visualizzare le diverse offerte disponibili e prenotare direttamente l'intervento desiderato.</p>\n          <p>Facile intuire il motivo di tanto apprezzamento da parte degli utilizzatori di questo servizio: oltre alla già citata semplicità di utilizzo e ai prezzi convenienti, a rassicurare coloro che scelgono i servizi di booking on line è la selezione dei professionisti che si appoggiano a queste piattaforme. Lo staff, infatti, garantisce che ogni addetto viene scelto per la sua capacità di rispondere alle richieste della clientela, rispettando obblighi di legge e standard elevati. Un ottimo modo per fare sì che domanda e offerta si incontrino.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.starbook.co/company/promotions\" target=\"_blank\"><img

Si ricorda che è importante controllare tutte le informazioni immesse e correggere eventuali errori prima di cliccare sul pulsante o di selezionarlo poiché, dopo averlo fatto, il procedimento di elaborazione dell’Acquisto ha inizio e non è più possibile correggere eventuali errori.\\n        </p>\\n        <p class=\\\"description\\\">\\n          <strong>Modifica o annullamento dell’Acquisto: </strong>Una volta che l’Acquisto è stato inoltrato e il pagamento è stato autorizzato non è più possibile modificare o annullare l’Acquisto Contatto. Ove desideri modificare o annullare l’Acquisto, l’utente può rivolgersi al Servizio Clienti inviando una mail, il quale tenterà di modificare l'acquisto. Non vi è alcuna assicurazione, tuttavia, riguardo al fatto che il Servizio Clienti sarà in grado di modificare l'acquisto in quanto il processo di elaborazione dell’Acquisto potrebbe avere già avuto inizio.

Si specifica che qualsiasi pagina di conferma che l’utente possa visualizzare sul Sito e qualsiasi conferma di Acquisto che l’utente stesso riceva tramite e-mail indicano esclusivamente che l'Acquisto dell’utente è stato assegnato o è in corso. STARBOOK incoraggia tutti i propri professionisti ad accettare tutti gli Acquisti ed a comunicare tempestivamente eventuali rifiuti, e comunica all’utente (generalmente tramite e-mail) non appena sia ragionevolmente possibile ogni eventuale rifiuto da parte del professionista. In ogni caso, i professionisti possono scegliere di rifiutare i contatti Acquistati in qualsiasi momento per il fatto di essere eccessivamente impegnati, a causa delle condizioni atmosferiche o per qualsiasi altra ragione.\\n        </p>\\n        <!-- <p class=\\\"description\\\">\\n          <strong>Finitura del servizio:</strong> I tempi stimati per i servizi dal inizio a fine lavori variano tra 1-30 giorni a seconda del tipo di servizio acquistato.

Qualora il prezzo esatto di un Contatto sia più elevato o più basso del normale, STARBOOK normalmente provvede a correggere il prezzo e eventualmente rimborsare il professionista con la differenza del prezzo, in caso il prezzo è più basso ad adebitare il professionista con la differenza.\\n        </p>\\n        <p class=\\\"description\\\">\\n          <strong>Modalità di pagamento:</strong> Il pagamento dei servizi deve essere effettuato mediante una carta di credito/debito.\\n        </p>\\n\\n        <p class=\\\"subtitle\\\"><strong>PIANO BASE</strong></p>\\n        <p class=\\\"description\\\">\\n          1.

Nel momento della chiusura della richiesta parte il sistema dei rimborsi in forma di CREDITI.<br>\\n          9. Se il cliente non ha promosso nessun professionista, la spesa del contatto viene diviso equalmente tra i professionisti che hanno acquistato e rimborsato il resto in forma di credito STARBOOK fino a novantacinque percento (anche in caso di un solo professionista).<br>\\n          10. Se il cliente ha promosso un professionista, i professionisti che non sono stati promossi potranno avere un rimborso in forma di credito STARBOOK fino a novantacinque percento.<br>\\n          11. Il Credito STARBOOK si potrà ricevere solo quando la richiesta del lavoro è stata terminata.
